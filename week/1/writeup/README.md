	If I was an auditor in this scenario, I would immediately tell my direct boss about the situation. If they refuse to do anything about the problem then I would go to their boss. I would keep trying to go up the chain of command if none of my superiors react to the problem. Reporting the information outside of the company to a consumer watchdog or the public would be my last resort. I would prefer to leak the information to a consumer watchdog or a government regulatory service before going directly to the public. The consumer watchdog group would have more credibility than I would in releasing the information myself and the government regulatory service would be able to force the company to make the necessary fixes or face financial or other penalties. If nothing happens after I inform either of those agencies then I would release that information to the public. 
	I believe that not doing anything (at all) about the vulnerabilities makes you responsible for any harm caused by an exploit. Knowing about the issue but not taking any action to resolve it is negligence. In this case by not taking any action, you are putting the lives of the people driving the cars with the compromised Engine Control Units in danger. Even if the company is trying to protect their reputation or avoid the costs to fix the issue, I feel that the PR disaster that would be created from the issue being exploited would outweigh the cost of time and resources it would take to fix the problem.
